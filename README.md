# Distributed Bank ATM implementation

A basic distributed bank server respoding to requests made by the bank's ATMs (clients). Implemented using Python's Flask framework to create a simple yet fully function REST API.

Tech stack:
- Python 3.8+
- Flask framwork 
- Flask-RESTful extension
- MongoDB (remote server)

The master branch features the Google RPC implementation. Feel free to check out the other branches for the rest of the implementations.
