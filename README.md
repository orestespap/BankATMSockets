# Distributed Bank ATM implementation

A basic distributed bank server respoding to requests made by the bank's ATMs (clients). Implemented using Python's Spyne library to create a simple yet fully functional SOAP web server.

Tech stack:
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB (remote server)

To run the app, first install all of the dependencies by executing the following command:

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

Then, launch the server by running Server.py and atmInterface.py to launch the client user interface in the command prompt.

The master branch features the Google RPC implementation. Feel free to check out the other branches for the rest of the implementations.
