# Distributed Bank ATM implementation

A basic single threaded bank server respoding to requests made by the bank's ATMs (clients). Implemented using Zero RPC.

Make sure you have the following modules installed (I didn't create a requirements.txt file since the list is short):
- pymonogo
- zerorpc
- traceback

To run the app, just run Server.py and atmInterface.py (which is the client) in two different shells.

Tech stack:
- Python
- MongoDB (remote server)
